# ECG Prediction and Analysis System

## Overview
This project is an advanced ECG prediction and analysis application that leverages machine learning, a user-friendly Flutter-based front-end, and a secure backend using SQL and Firebase. The system classifies ECG signals into four categories: Normal, Abnormal Heartbeat, Myocardial Infarction (MI), and History of MI. Designed for scalability and real-world medical use, the application provides accurate ECG analysis with secure data handling.
